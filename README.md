# Conditional-Statement-in-C++
Experiment No.: 5
Name: To study and implement C++ decision making with statement
Tools Used: VS code
Theory: Conditional statements (if, else if, else) and switch statements are control flow tools in C++ used to make decisions in a program.

- if-else is used for comparing values and performing actions based on true/false conditions.
- switch is used when a variable is compared with multiple constant values.
Algorithm:
Program 1: Check Even or Odd

Step 1. Start
Step 2. Input a number
Step 3. If number % 2 == 0, print "Even"
Step 4. Else, print "Odd"
Step 5. Stop

Program 2: Vowel or Consonant

Step 1. Start
Step 2. Input a character
Step 3. If character is in {A, E, I, O, U, a, e, i, o, u}, print "Vowel"
Step 4. Else, print "Consonant"
Step 5. Stop


Program 3: Largest of Three Numbers

Step 1. Start
Step 2. Input three numbers a, b, c
Step 3. Compare a, b, and c using nested `if-else`
Step 4. Print the largest number
Step 5. Stop


Program 4: Weekday from Day Number

Step 1. Start
Step 2. Input a number between 1–7
Step 3. Use `switch` to map number to corresponding day
Step 4. Print the weekday or error if invalid
Step 5. Stop

Program 5: Simple Calculator using `switch`

Step 1. Start
Step 2. Input two numbers
Step 3. Display menu (1–Addition, 2–Subtraction, etc.)
Step 4. Input choice
Step 5. Use `switch` to perform the selected operation
Step 6. Print the result
Step 7. Stop

Conclusion

This experiment enhanced understanding of how to implement logic in C++ using conditional and switch statements, allowing the program to make decisions based on user inputs or defined rules.
